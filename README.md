## About

Just like [Gumori You](https://github.com/importantimport/gumori-you), but different.

It is similar to [Gumori](https://github.com/importantimport/gumori)'s unstyled templates and is deeply bound to [Shiraha](https://github.com/importantimport/shiraha), a Classless CSS framework inspired by Material 3.

So in this theme you can expect:

- Dynamic theme colors based on [Shiraha Colors](https://github.com/importantimport/shiraha/tree/main/packages/shiraha-colors) / Material Color Utilities
- Similar design to Material 3 but different
- FFF Flavored Frontmatter experience
- Long term maintenance like Urara
